# Concepts Covered

1. Functions

   - greet(name) ‚Äì Greets the user with their name.
   - square(num) ‚Äì Returns the square of a number.
   - is_even(n) ‚Äì Checks if a number is even.
   - sum_numbers(a, b=10) ‚Äì Returns the sum of two numbers with default argument handling.
   - factorial(n) ‚Äì Calculates the factorial using recursion.

2. Lambda Functions & Filters

   - Use of lambda and filter() to extract even numbers from a list.

3. Loops

   - while loop to print the first 5 multiples of 3.
   - for loop to print numbers from 1 to 20, skipping multiples of 5.
   - Loop that terminates when it encounters the number 7 in a list.

4. Conditionals
   - Leap year checker using nested if conditions with proper rules:
   - Divisible by 4
   - Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400

# Skills Practiced

    * Function creation with/without default arguments
    * Lambda expressions and functional programming
    * Recursion and control flow
    * for and while loop mastery
    * Conditional branching (if, elif, else)
    * Real-world logic implementation (e.g., leap year check)
